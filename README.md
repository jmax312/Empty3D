##Motion Ocean

This app creates a pleasant "ocean" that can be watched for as long as one desires. It uses a mesh whose z coordinates move based on signed noise, sine, and cosine. Just hit play to enjoy.

If you want to have an ocean that starts out slow but gains speed over time, change the radius value in setup to zero, and uncomment the radius line in update (there are comments in the code to show you where).
